# Welcome to ChessPuzzleKnocker üëã

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/fbrec04diyk4vf2s/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Youssef1313/chesssharp/branch/master)

ChessPuzzleKnocker is a chess training tool built in C#. The repository includes the WinForms app and a the ChessSharp library, which I forked to create this application. 

## Install the package
  Just extract the zip-file found under Releases.

## Repository structure

The repository consists of three folders:

- `Documentation` folder: This folder is generated by [docFX](https://github.com/dotnet/docfx).  TODO: is this true?
- `docs` folder: This is the actual website (defaultly called `_site`) generated by docFX. It's rendered by GitHub pages in [https://youssef1313.github.io/ChessSharp/](https://youssef1313.github.io/ChessSharp/). TODO: is this true?
- `src` folder: This folder contains the actual source code and contains these folders:
    - `AwiUtils`: SOme generally usable utilities  that I use in many projects. 
    - `ChessSharp`: The source code of the ChessSharp Library, originally from [https://youssef1313.github.io/ChessSharp/](https://youssef1313.github.io/ChessSharp/). I've improved it and fixed some bugs, though. 
    - `ChessUI`: The ChessPuzzleKnocker app.  It consumes the ChessSharp library.
    - `ChessSharpWeb`: an ASP.NET Core MVC project that consumes the library. **Not completed, and not working currently.**
